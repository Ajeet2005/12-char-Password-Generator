Github Action(CI/CD) Integrated
This CI/CD workflow automatically runs every time code is pushed to the main branch, checks out the latest repository files on a clean Ubuntu environment, verifies that essential files like index.html exist to catch basic issues early, and only proceeds to deployment if all checks pass—ensuring that broken or incomplete code is stopped before deployment while successful commits are deployed automatically.
